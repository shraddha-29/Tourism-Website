 Dear Visitor,<br><br>
 Welcome to Rajasthan, fascinating Rajasthan.<br><br>
This land is a colourful melange of massive forts, stunning palaces, diverse cultures, delectable cuisines and
 warm people, set amidst a rugged yet inviting landscape.<br><br>
It is a land that has inspired me and countless others. Come tread on the sands of time. In Rajasthan you will find
 every hue in Nature's grand palette - the red sands, the blue of royalty, the pink cities or the amber sunsets. 
 Surrender yourself to the sounds of trinkets or the sounds of the all conquering wind. Sight and sounds that are
 far removed from any city. Sights and sounds that will transport you into a folk lore.Music, art and dance is woven 
 into every inch of this land I call paradise. You will find it carved in every grain of sand. Here you will find the 
 past, the present and the future. You will find passion. You will find adventure. And you will find yourself!!!!
