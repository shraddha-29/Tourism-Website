<p class="descriptionr">The "Pink City" of Jaipur forms part of India's renowned Golden Triangle Tourist Circuit and
 is one of the Rajasthan's most popular destinations. It has many famous forts and palaces, with most of them boasting 
 stunning views and elaborate architecture. Staying in Jaipur is particularly enjoyable. Accommodations are reasonably
 priced and many have been converted from heritage properties, giving guests a very regal experience!</p><br>
 
<h1>2.UDAIPUR</h1>
<img class="imagesr" src="images/p1r2.jpg">
<p class="descriptionl">Udaipur is often said to be the most beautiful city in India, as it's filled with expansive lakes 
and old palaces. The exquisite City Palace Complex, which stretches along the eastern shore of Lake Pichola, dominates 
the city and the royal family still lives in part of it. Many personal royal heirlooms, family photos, and other memorabilia
 are displayed in the City Palace Museum, giving Udaipur a very regal feel. You can even stay in the City Palace!</p><br>

<h1>3.JAISALMER </h1>
<img class="imagesl" src="images/p1r3.jpg">
<p class="descriptionr">A remarkable sandstone city that rises magically from the sand dunes of the Thar desert, Jaisalmer looks 
like it's straight out of an Arabian Nights fable. Its mesmerizing ancient fort, built in 1156, is perched high on a pedestal 
overlooking the city. Inside, the fort is alive and spellbinding. It houses five palaces, several temples, and some exquisite 
havelis (mansions), as well as shops and other residences. Camels safaris into the desert are also a popular thing to do in Jaisalmer.</p><br>

<h1>4.JODHPUR</h1>
<img class="imagesr" src="images/p1r4.jpg">
<p class="descriptionl">Affectionately known as the "Blue City" for its blue painted buildings, Jodhpur is the second 
largest city in Rajasthan. The walled old part of the city is presided over by looming Mehrangarh Fort, which provides
 the best outlook across Jodhpur's blue buildings. It's one of the largest and most well-maintained forts in India. Inside,
 there are a number of ornate palaces and a museum. One of the appealing things about Jodhpur is that there are many inexpensive 
 yet characterful places to stay with views of the fort. It's great to do nothing but relax on their rooftops and soak up the atmosphere.</p><br>
